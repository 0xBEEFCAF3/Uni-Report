For constant uber users or Lyft users or even both, it is really inconvenient to open both apps to compare the price when you’re traveling. As a result, we figure that if there is a web application that can compare multiple taxi booking app at the same time, it will save a lot time for the users. Google map has similar idea, but we decide that there should be more app to compare since other taxi booking apps grow rapidly. If this web application is developed successfully, we believe it will have users more than Uber’s and lyft’s.
