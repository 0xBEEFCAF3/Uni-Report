As a log-in user, I want to be able to save any of the school characteristics that I like to an organized list. I am expecting seeing a bunch of options that I can click to find my ideal colleges after I logged in. There should at least be "location", "average SAT score", and "tuition fees". If I click one of the schools on the list, I want to see its information and I want to save it on my list if I like it. Whenever I log in, the web app should show me the list what I saved.
