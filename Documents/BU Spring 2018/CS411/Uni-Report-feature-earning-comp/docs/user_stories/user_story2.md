As a log-in user, I want to customize my portal with my accomplishments, test scores, school interests, etc. to get possible college matches. This way, every time I log on, I don't have to re-enter my statistics to see if I have a possible "chance" for a university of my choice. I want to have the option to categorize schools that are of interest as safety, match, or reach. The customization option should also suggest other schools that could possibly interest me.
