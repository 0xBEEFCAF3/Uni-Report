As a log-in user, I want to be able to save any of the school characteristics that I like to an organized list. 
I am expecting seeing a bunch of options that I can click to find my ideal colleges after I logged in. There should at least have "location", "average SAT score", and "tuition fees". After I saved the school characteristics in to an organized list, the web application should give me a list of school that matches my preference.

As a log-in user, I want to get a list of schools that I am qualified.                                                                             
If I put my information such as GPA, SAT score, and AP scores, the web application will save my information and will show me the schools which my condition meets their requirements. 
If I click one of the schools on the list, I want to see its information and I want to save it on my list if I like it. Whenever I log in, the web app should show me the list what I saved.
