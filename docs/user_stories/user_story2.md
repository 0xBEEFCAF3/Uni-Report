As a log-in user, I want to get a list of schools that I am qualified.                                                                             
If I put my information such as GPA, SAT score, and AP scores, the web application will save my information and will show me the schools which my condition meets their requirements. 
If I click one of the schools on the list, I want to see its information and I want to save it on my list if I like it. Whenever I log in, the web app should show me the list what I saved.
