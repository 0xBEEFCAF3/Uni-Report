As a log-in user, I want to be able to save any of the school characteristics that I like to an organized list. 
I am expecting seeing a bunch of options that I can click to find my ideal colleges after I logged in. There should at least be "location", "average SAT score", and "tuition fees". After I saved the school characteristics in to an organized list, the web application should give me a list of school that matches my preference.
